The Snake game can be controlled with the four direction buttons in relation to the direction it's heading into. The goal of playing the game is to score maximum points by grabbing food or fruits. The player is out of luck if the snake strikes the wall or itself.
It uses turtle which is a drawing tool in python.It is a pre-installed library in python.
